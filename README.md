# odin-recipes
Alright hi! Welcome to my first ever project, my name is Sofo (would like to be called Sofi though).

p.s im somewhat worried and nervous even though I know the basics of HTML

Alright now about the project! It is about recipes, I will use HTML to set the initial structure and then shape it. 
We have a Recipe page, it's content (with ordered and unordered lists!) and of course recipes itself.
