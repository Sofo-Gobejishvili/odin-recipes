            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p><em>"I have found myself making daily visits to Joseph's Classic Market these days and creating 
                    new recipes. Not only do we have amazing markets here in Palm Beach Gardens but our farmers 
                    markets are spectacular. I got 4 Cubanelle peppers and grilled 2 with our steak dinner. Looking 
                    at the remaining 2, this dish came to me. Enjoy with your favorite pasta, spaghetti squash, 
                    or sweet potato noodles."</em>- Chef <strong>Cindy Anschuts Barbieri</strong></p>
